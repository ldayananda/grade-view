grade-view
==========

A web-app to help estimate grades in a class based on criteria the user enters

Purpose: During a semester it is difficult to grasp where exactly you stand as different classes have different grading schemes and potentials for extra credit + dropped quizzes/exams. As of right now, I have been unable to find a web or mobile app that allowed a level of tailoring that is required for me to track my progress in a class. So I'm making my own.

Overview
--------

Classes are broken down as specificed by the user. Potential sections could be:
  - assignments
  - exams
  - homeworks
  - quizzes
  - labs

These sections are recorded with their respective weights and the number of assignments expected.

A culmalative "score" of the class is calculated each time the class is viewed to give the user a good sense of how they are doing.
